We are the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee and our job is to make sure that scientists have a common language to use when discussing genes. We approve unique symbols and names for human loci, including protein coding genes, ncRNA genes and pseudogenes, to allow unambiguous scientific communication.

Here’s a figure from our recent [NAR paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30304474).

The purple region represents genes annotated with the non-protein-coding RNA locus group; the smaller chart shows the proportion of RNA genes annotated with each RNA-specific locus type. The ‘misc RNA’ category groups together RNA locus types that represent a small number of genes. 

A full list of locus types, along with total numbers of approved symbols for each category, can be viewed at our [Statistics and Downloads facility](https://www.genenames.org/download/statistics-and-files/). You can also download by chromosome, or download our [gene groups dataset](https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genegroup/download-all). We’ll discuss our gene groups further in upcoming blog posts - this is a growing resource which we hope will be increasingly useful to the scientific community.

Also coming up….

* A guide to our [Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC)](https://vertebrate.genenames.org/) project.
* Feature articles about new developments within HGNC.
* ‘How-to’ guides e.g. downloading and importing gene symbol data.
* Highlights from our talks and posters and conferences that we attend.

We welcome any feedback or requests for articles about particular topics you would like to see covered. You can get in touch with us through the [HGNC website](https://www.genenames.org/contact/feedback/), by [emailing us](mailto:hgnc@genenames.org) or via Twitter @genenames.
