We are the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee and our job is to make sure that scientists have a common language to use when discussing genes. We approve unique symbols and names for human loci, including protein coding genes, ncRNA genes and pseudogenes, to allow unambiguous scientific communication.

Here’s a figure from our recent [NAR paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30304474) showing the proportion of HGNC gene symbols annotated with each locus type. The purple region represents genes annotated with the non-protein-coding RNA locus group; the smaller chart shows the proportion of RNA genes annotated with each RNA-specific locus type. The ‘misc RNA’ category groups together RNA locus types that represent a small number of genes. 

A full list of locus types, along with total numbers of approved symbols for each category, can be viewed via our [Statistics and Downloads facility](https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/statistics) on our website. You can also download by chromosome, or download our
[gene groups dataset](https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genefamilies/download-all/tsv). We’ll discuss our gene groups further in upcoming blog posts - this is a growing resource which we hope will be useful to the scientific community.
