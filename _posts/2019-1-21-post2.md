Welcome back - this time we’re going to begin discussing our VGNC project, established in 2016 as an extension of the HGNC. 

The [Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC)](https://vertebrate.genenames.org/) assigns standardized nomenclature in line with human for vertebrate species that lack their own nomenclature committees.

The VGNC uses a software pipeline based on the HGNC Consensus Orthology Predictions [(HCOP)](https://www.genenames.org/tools/hcop/) tool to transfer human nomenclature across to other species automatically for genes where the same orthologs are predicted across four different resources: [Ensembl] (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html), [NCBI Gene] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene), [OMA] (https://omabrowser.org/oma/home/) and Panther (http://www.pantherdb.org/genes/). 

 For genes where there is no such consensus ortholog prediction, naming is based on a combination of a semi-automated pipeline and manual curation, taking into account synteny, phylogeny and other data. We also rely on the expertise of specialist advisors for naming within complex families. 

The current species for VGNC naming are chimpanzee, horse, cow and dog and we’ll update you here as we add new species to the list.  

VGNC began naming chimpanzee genes in 2016 and over the past two years the total number of protein-coding chimpanzee genes has increased by 1250 to 15 752 due to continued manual curation efforts. In the same period we have extended the process to assign nomenclature for protein-coding genes in cow (14 181), dog (13 983) and horse (13 378). The NCBI Gene and Ensembl databases now display approved VGNC nomenclature for all relevant entries, along with reciprocal links to the symbol reports on the VGNC site.
